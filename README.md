# DatePicker UI
Building datepicker seems easy at first but when you actually assign valuesto different divs
and try to align all of them, their positiioning, layouts gets a little tricky. 

## Tech Stack: HTML & CSS

## Things to remember while buulding it:
+ Firstly, draw a rough design to get an idea of layout
+ Assign it proper height, width values to each column, row and the boxes within
+ TAKE SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON POSITIONING, WHICH FLEX DIRECTION TO USE IN WHICH CONTAINER
